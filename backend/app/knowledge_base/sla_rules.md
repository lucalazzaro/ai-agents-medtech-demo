# SLA and Escalation Rules

- First response to critical incidents: within 2 hours.
- Provide an initial triage summary and next update time in the first response.
- Do not commit to fix timelines without engineering confirmation.
- Escalate to technical support for repeated incidents or safety-related reports.
- Provide a workaround when possible and document the root cause investigation.
