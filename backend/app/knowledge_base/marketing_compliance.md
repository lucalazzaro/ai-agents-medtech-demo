# Marketing Compliance (MedTech)

- Avoid absolute performance claims (e.g., "guarantees results", "always improves outcomes").
- Use qualified language and cite evidence when available.
- Include clear disclaimers when describing clinical or patient-related benefits.
- Do not imply regulatory approval unless explicitly verified.
- Claims must match approved, reviewed messaging guidelines.
